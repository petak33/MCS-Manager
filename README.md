# Minecraft-Server-Manager
Minecraft Server Manager for short MCS-Manager was made to help you manage your minecraft servers. 

Currently, we're supporting vanilla, forge and fabric versions of minecraft. MCS-Manager supports any version of minecraft vanilla servers, forge is supported from version 1.5.2 and up and all versions of fabric are supported. 

With MCS-Manager you can delete/create a server by choosing version and name of your new server, you can modify server properties and remove/download mods using only URL of a mod (currently supporting only 9minecraft, mc-mod, mod-minecraft file hosting and any direct .jar download URL) 
and then, of course, you can also start your server up with ram limit of your choosing.
